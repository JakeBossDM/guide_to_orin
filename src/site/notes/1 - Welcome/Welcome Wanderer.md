“To the bold and curious who wander these lands, I bid you welcome to Orin. Once a distant dream beyond the waves of Faerûn, this land now stands as a testament to the tenacity of those who dare to carve out a new destiny. When we first set foot upon Orin’s shores, we found a world untamed—a place of unyielding beauty, harsh wilderness, and secrets buried deep beneath its soil. It is a land both wild and wonderful, filled with stories waiting to be told and dangers eager to test your mettle.

The mountains of the Graven Range rise like jagged spines across the heart of the continent, dividing its fertile south from its arid north. Rivers like the shimmering Moonstrand carve lifelines through the land, feeding thriving settlements like Lorendel and the Bayou. To the west, the Merrygold River stretches across Orin carrying both opportunity and peril to places like Brewhaven and Brineshore. Every corner of Orin tells a tale—a new frontier teeming with possibility.

You will find here a world that challenges even the most seasoned adventurer. Its people are as varied as its lands—farmers, traders, scholars, hunters, and wanderers like yourself. Each has a story to tell, a struggle to share, and a stake in what Orin becomes. You will meet beings of light and shadow, find wonders beyond reckoning, and perhaps uncover secrets that were meant to remain buried.

I write these words not as a mapmaker nor a historian, but as one who once walked this uncharted world, who battled its beasts and sought its treasures. Orin is a place that rewards courage and wit, but make no mistake—it will punish the careless. Respect its dangers as you marvel at its wonders, and you may yet forge a legend here, just as we did.

The path ahead is yours to choose. Will you find glory in the lush southern lands? Will the dry, harsh north test your resolve? Or perhaps the treacherous waters of the The Great Sea will carry you to your fate? The answers lie beyond the horizon, awaiting those brave enough to seek them.

May your journey be prosperous, your blade sharp, and your companions true.”

— Orindar Thalessman, Trailblazer of Orin
