The **Infinite Layers of the Abyss**  was the birth place of the demons, a chaotic evil universe unto itself with uncountable layers of infinite variety connected haphazardly. The Abyss's place in the cosmology of the Forgotten Realms shifted over time, but the nature of the plane remained fairly constant: a violent, malevolent place where the strong survived on the backs of the weak, the weak conspired to overthrow the strong, alliances only lasted while convenient, and the landscape itself tortured the mind and body of all who dared to pass.

“*Ah, the infinite wonders of the Abyss. If there's anything you don't like, you'll find it here.*”

— *A Tanar'ri saying.*
