"It is the toxic plane of darkness and power.  
It is the hidden place that hates the light.  
It is the frontier of worlds unknown."

The Plane of Shadow (or Shadowfell) is a realm of darkness and despair. It is a place of muted color and dim light, where the sky is devoid of sun, moon, or stars. All colors appear as shades of black, and light sources are weakened, casting only half their usual illumination. Despite this, any light source stands out in the constant gloom and can be seen from far away.

The Shadowfell mirrors the Material Plane but in a twisted and ever-changing way, making mapping nearly impossible. Locations in the Shadowfell are distorted echoes of their Material Plane counterparts, often appearing altered, decayed, or bizarrely reshaped. Frequent small earthquakes, known as shadow quakes, disturb the landscape and can disrupt magical travel through the plane.

Some areas, called "darklands," are tied to the Negative Energy Plane and are inhabited by life-draining undead like vampires and shadows. These regions can drain the life force of anyone who lingers too long. Other areas feature unsettling mirages of people and places from the Material Plane, distorted into eerie nightmares.

Despite its harshness, the Shadowfell supports life, including plants, animals, and some humanoids adapted to its environment. However, visitors face constant cold, foul-smelling water, and unsettling sensations of being watched. Prolonged exposure to the plane can alter living beings, dulling their emotions and changing their traits.

The morphic nature of the Shadowfell can lead to strange phenomena, such as spontaneously appearing skeletons, ephemeral shadowstuff, and surreal landscapes like forests of grasping tendrils or mushrooms with humanoid faces. The planeâ€™s connection to death and shadow makes it a haunting, alien, and deeply unsettling place.
