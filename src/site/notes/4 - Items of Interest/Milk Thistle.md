Milk Thistle is a lifeline for the people of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Bayou\|The Bayou]]. It is considered one of the best healing remedies by the people there. It can be found near the marshy shores of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Moonstrand River\|Moonstrand River]] poking out of the water. 

It is named after the milky color of the tail at the end of the stem. It can often be confused with a small “cattail” that also grows in freshwater. Another reason for its name is that when chewed it is a very soft and smooth in texture. The people of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Bayou\|The Bayou]] often compare it to drinking a nice cup of fresh milk.
