Moonstone is a rare material found in the peaks of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]]. It is known for being very difficult to obtain. Not only to break free from the ore it has built into, but the dangers of the journey up the mountains can also be daunting. 

This material is a very difficult material to craft with, not any ordinary blacksmith will be able to forge it down. Some say that moonstone also has some other unique properties that you will not find in any common metal or stone.
