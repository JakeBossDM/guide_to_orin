The Celestial Vein is the formal name of the veins of arcana that flow through the city of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. It is used to light the torches and lamps throughout the city, and to fuel many advanced machinery and equipment. This vein especially supplies the [[College of New Lariel\|College of New Lariel]] with a raw source of arcana for students to use and work with in the classrooms. 
The massive walls that surround the city is also imbued by the vein. The military claim that it strengthens the walls and is the strongest structure to be still standing in all of Orin. 

This is a source that most say built the city of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. People often say that it is the life force of the city itself. That without it the city would crumble. But others theorize that it is a curse, that will drain the land of Orin of its nutrients one day in the future. 

Though all of this is uncertain. There are many mysteries of the vein. No one knows exactly where the celestial vein came from, or how it was unleashed onto the land. This is what gives it its name. For when it first was released into the land and crops of Lariel, the people claimed it was a gift from the goddess Chauntea, the goddess of agriculture.
