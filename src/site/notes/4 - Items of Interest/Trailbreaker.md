Orindar is said to have wielded a blade named [[4 - Items of Interest/Trailbreaker\|Trailbreaker]], a longsword imbued with enchantments that allowed him to cut through dense wilderness and even withstand the harsh elements they faced in the mountains. Some say the sword was lost after his death, while others believe it remains hidden in Orin, waiting for someone worthy to wield it.

Little is known of what exactly this blade was capable of. But sadly it has yet to be found, hopefully one day a scholar such as myself will run across it.
