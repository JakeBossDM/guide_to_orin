Location: DECEASED

Orindar Thalessman was the bold and visionary leader of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/The Trailblazers\|The Trailblazers]], the group of adventurers who first discovered the land that would come to be known as [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.1 History & Events/2. Orin's Landscape\|2. Orin's Landscape]]. A human warrior-scholar of remarkable charisma and tactical brilliance, Orindar was known for his unyielding determination and a deep curiosity about the unknown. His leadership brought [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/The Trailblazers\|The Trailblazers]] through uncharted wilderness, harsh terrains, and strange dangers that marked their journey to [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.1 History & Events/2. Orin's Landscape\|2. Orin's Landscape]].

  

According to legend, Orindar was the first to set eyes on the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Moonstrand River\|Moonstrand River]] and the towering [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]], naming them as he envisioned the future of the land they had found. He believed [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.1 History & Events/2. Orin's Landscape\|2. Orin's Landscape]] could become a land of unity and prosperity, free from the fractured politics and conflicts of Faerûn, and he was instrumental in rallying the other Trailblazers around this vision.

  

Orindar is said to have wielded a blade named [[4 - Items of Interest/Trailbreaker\|Trailbreaker]], a longsword imbued with enchantments that allowed him to cut through dense wilderness and even withstand the harsh elements they faced in the mountains. Some say the sword was lost after his death, while others believe it remains hidden in Orin, waiting for someone worthy to wield it.



Orindar’s legacy is immortalized not only in the name of the continent but also in the values he sought to instill in its people: resilience, cooperation, and the courage to face the unknown. Statues of him, often depicted with Trailbreaker in hand, stand in many of Orin’s major cities, and his name is spoken with reverence among scholars and adventurers alike.
