The Trailblazers were a legendary group of adventurers from [[2 - The World As We Know It/2. Faerûn\|2. Faerûn]] who first set foot on the uncharted lands of Orin centuries ago. Driven by curiosity and a thirst for discovery, they braved unknown dangers and crossed the treacherous seas to explore the vast and wild continent. It is said they paved the way for civilization in Orin, mapping the land’s many regions and leaving behind a legacy of daring exploration and resilience. Towns, trade routes, and even some traditions trace their origins back to the Trailblazers’ early exploits. Though much of their story has faded into legend, they are remembered as the first to unlock the secrets of Orin’s untamed wilderness.
