Talo's served as one of the youngest warriors to serve during the Abyssal war. She is renowned for being brave enough to fight for her land at just the age of 14. She then fought her way up the ranks of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]] military until she reached the rank of General. In her older age she was sent to recruit as many strong, young bucks as she could to fight for Orin and its people. She would travel all across the land if it meant to help a single soul. These traits are what put Talos in her rightful place as General. A great warrior, but an even greater person.
