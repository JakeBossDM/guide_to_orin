## The Discovery of Orin

- A legendary group of adventurers from [[2 - The World As We Know It/2. Faerûn\|2. Faerûn]] known collectively as [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/The Trailblazers\|The Trailblazers]] discovered the land of Orin while pursuing a new start apart from Faerun. Sailing across uncharted waters, they stumbled upon Orin’s unspoiled wilderness, a land teeming with natural resources, strange ruins, and unfamiliar creatures.

-  [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/The Trailblazers\|The Trailblazers]] named the land Orin after their leader, [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/Orindar Thalessan\|Orindar Thalessan]], a half-elf ranger who dreamed of founding a realm where explorers and outcasts could forge new lives.

- Early settlements, such as the coastal town of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brewhaven\|Brewhaven]], were established to serve as bases for further exploration inland. These settlements later grew into hubs of trade and governance.

## The Era of Expansion

- With word of Orin’s discovery spreading across [[2 - The World As We Know It/2. Faerûn\|2. Faerûn]], adventurers, settlers, and opportunists flooded the region. [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]] was founded in the lush southern lands, becoming a bastion of human and elven cooperation.

-  Explorers ventured northward into the harsh plains and mountainous regions, establishing smaller towns and mining settlements. This included the founding of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brewhaven\|Brewhaven]], and the Elven city of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Lorendel\|Lorendel]] at the edge of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]].

-  During this time, explorers uncovered remnants of a forgotten civilization in [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]]. Strange ruins and ancient texts hinted at a powerful people who once called Orin home, but no conclusive answers about their fate were found.

- [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]] grew exponentially with the help of an an ancient arcane essence, this later became known as the [[4 - Items of Interest/Celestial Vein\|Celestial Vein]] found and developed by an Elven mage/artificer named [[Rina Arwin\|Rina Arwin]]. This newfound source, produced energy and arcane throughout [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. As the years passed, the essence expanded into the soil even granting farmers higher rates of crops year around. Although [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]] now had these advancements, they had learned how to direct small amounts of the energy, but were unable to harness this power in order to defend Orin from outside threats. 

  
  ## The Abyssal War

-  The discovery of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]‘s ancient arcana inadvertently attracted an otherworldly terror: a rift to the [[Abyssal Realm\|Abyssal Realm]] was opened. Demons poured forth, threatening to consume all of Orin.

-  A coalition of Orin’s people—humans, elves, dwarves, and various other groups of people—united to fight the Abyssal forces. Forces from far realms came to the aid of Orin, such as the [[2 - The World As We Know It/4. Feywild\|4. Feywild]] and [[2 - The World As We Know It/6. Inner planes\|6. Inner planes]]. For this was not only a threat to Orin, but to the Material Plane as a whole. This conflict became known as The Abyssal War. 

- Legendary heroes rose during this war, including [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/General Talos\|General Talos]] of New Lariel, a strategist whose tactics turned the tide of battle. Along with the warriors from the [[2 - The World As We Know It/8. Elemental Chaos\|8. Elemental Chaos]] that wielded the [[Rings of Chaos\|Rings of Chaos]]. The war ended when the rift was sealed by the power of these rings together. 

- The caves beneath the Graven Range, once used as a refuge by fleeing survivors, became sacred to many, their tunnels forever marked by the war’s horrors.

  

## The Age of Division

-  The unity forged during the Abyssal War fractured as the need for cooperation waned. Disputes over land, trade, and cultural differences led to growing tensions among Orin’s regions.

-  The northern regions, struggling with the harsh plains and limited resources, grew resentful of the lush south’s prosperity. Some settlements turned to mercenary work or banditry to survive.

- This period saw the rise of organizations such as the [[House of the Vanguard\|House of the Vanguard]], a monster-hunting guild formed to protect smaller settlements, and The Ebon Conclave, a secretive group of mages and nobles with unclear motives.

- Though there was divisions that occurred in Orin. The King of New Lariel pushed for unity between the people of Orin. The King used all his power to do so, expanding imported goods to spread the land other than New Lariel. At the same time, this opened up the market for smaller villages such as [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brewhaven\|Brewhaven]], [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Port Briar\|Port Briar]], and [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Lorendel\|Lorendel]] to thrive. 

## Era of Peace

- Because of this big economy push across Orin, it allowed for more tourism, travel, and trade throughout the country. This created a peaceful era for Orin.

- New Lariel’s military was spread throughout the country to create a feeling of safety for the people. Most towns transitioned them to be their own city guards in time.
