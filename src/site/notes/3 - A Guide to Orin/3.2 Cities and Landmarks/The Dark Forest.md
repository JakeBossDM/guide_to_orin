A wilting flower in a field of daylilies. This is what the Dark Forest is in comparison to the rest of southern Orin. What was once a beautiful lush, dense forest  is now nothing but dread and decay. Each tree seemingly to have had their life stolen from them. Roots, vines, and thorns make it difficult for any adventurer to make passage through the forest. 

A dense fog consumes the understory of the large trees throughout the forest. Just another thing to make difficult for wandering traveler. 

Some reports say that being in the forest for a long period of time can distort the mind. Leading people to hear and see things that would not normally be there. 

In the heart of the Dark Forest lies a fortress that seems to have been built in ancient times. A tower lingers alone overlooking the canopyâ€™s of the forest. The tower reportedly being protected by the vegetation itself, as no humanoid has reported stepping foot in the tower walls. All this giving its name of [[The Lone Tower\|The Lone Tower]]. 

The Dark Forest is also known for being home to many dangerous monstrosities and creatures. Some even report of seeing abberations dwelling deep within. Because of the many monstrosities and creatures being here it has attracted certain groups of people to visit. Such as the [[Blackthorn Vanguard\|Blackthorn Vanguard]] and the druids of the bayou. They search here to find unique and exotic goods to be sold in various regions. Some of these products could be found in an arcane shop or a traveling merchant, but the more rare ones can be found in the black market.

The Dark Forest is not one to meddle with. It is one that earns the respect of the strongest warriors.
