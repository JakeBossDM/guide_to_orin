The Verdant Steps are a breathtaking expanse of rolling green hills stretching across the southeasternmost reaches of Orin. The landscape is a patchwork of wildflower-dotted meadows, small winding creeks, and well-tended farmlands, all shaped by generations of halflings and gnomes who call this place home. The hills get their name from the way they cascade down in gentle, step-like terraces, naturally formed over time by wind and water.

  

At the heart of the Verdant Steps lies the village of [[Tumblespring\|Tumblespring]], a cozy and welcoming settlement where halflings and gnomes live in harmony. Built into the hillsides, many of the homes are burrowed beneath the earth, with round doors and lush gardens on their rooftops. Stone bridges cross over the babbling brooks that weave through town, and a large communal square sits at its center, where festivals and feasts are held frequently.

  

To the west, a serene lake separates the Verdant Steps from the ominous [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Dark Forest\|The Dark Forest]]. At its center rests a small, mist-covered island known as Everwhisper Glade. The island is a place of deep magic, where the wind carries faint, melodic whispers. Some say the spirits of the land speak to those who listen, while others believe itâ€™s simply the way the trees and water shape the breeze. Ancient, twisted willows drape their branches over the lake, their silver leaves rustling with unseen voices. The glade is often visited by druids, scholars, and those seeking guidance, as it is said that true seekers may hear answers whispered on the wind.

  

Despite its tranquil appearance, the Verdant Steps are not without their dangers as wandering beasts from the nearby wilds occasionally threaten traveler.
