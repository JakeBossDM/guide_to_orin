The Graven Range is a towering wall of jagged peaks and shadowed valleys that slices through the heart of Orin, dividing the lush southern lands from the dry northern plains. Its snow-capped peaks pierce the clouds, while dense evergreen forests blanket its lower slopes. The air here is sharp and cold, and the wind howls through the craggy cliffs like a mournful cry.

  
Legends speak of an ancient civilization that once thrived within the mountains, carving massive strongholds into the stone. Now, their ruins lie abandoned, scattered across the range like forgotten relics.

  
Despite its natural beauty, the Graven Range holds a foreboding presence. The land feels heavy, as though burdened by an old scar. Strange whispers are said to echo through the dark caves, and shadows move unnaturally in the forests. Few dare to venture into its depths, for the mountains are home to more than just wild beastsâ€”some say remnants of an ancient war still linger, watching those who tread too close.
