If there was ever a place that could be confused with the [[2 - The World As We Know It/5. Shadowfell\|5. Shadowfell]], this would be the place. The Witherlands gained its title for how no life can be grown here. The land is made up of nothing but dried shrubs and trees, a rigid, rocky surface, and creatures that lurk in the darkness. The weary should never step foot in such a place, for they may never make it out alive. Many men were lost to the Withers when we first arrived in Orin. 

Heed my words traveler.
