The Pirate Strait is a narrow stretch of water between the beaches west of  [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brewhaven\|Brewhaven]] and [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brineshore\|Brineshore]]. Its calm, clear blue waters are often bathed in sunlight, creating a serene and peaceful atmosphere. However, the waters can be unpredictable at times, with hidden sandbars and swift currents. It serves as a key route for trade and travel between the two coastal locations.
