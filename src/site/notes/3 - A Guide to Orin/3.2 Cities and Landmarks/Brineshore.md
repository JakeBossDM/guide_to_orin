Tempest Isle is a bustling, chaotic island town perched on the western shores of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.1 History & Events/2. Orin's Landscape\|2. Orin's Landscape]]. The narrow, winding streets are filled with the constant ebb and flow of sailors, pirates, and fishermen. It’s a place where the clang of hammers on shipyards competes with the drunken laughter from nearby taverns. The town has a distinctly rough and ready atmosphere — it’s neither poor nor rich, but everyone here is used to a bit of disorder.

  

The island is divided into sections that cater to different crowds. On the western edge, the shipyards and docks are always busy with trade and ships coming in and out. The central market district is a hodgepodge of vendor stalls, selling everything from fresh fish to stolen goods. Meanwhile, the eastern part of the island houses the seedier taverns and underground gambling rings, popular among the pirates and off-duty sailors.

  

The locals, hardened by the ever-present sway of the ocean, are tough but welcoming to those with coin in hand. Tempest Isle might not be the prettiest place, but it sure is a place of opportunity — if you know where to look.
