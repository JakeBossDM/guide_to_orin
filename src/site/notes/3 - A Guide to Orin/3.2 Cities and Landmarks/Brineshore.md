# 🏴‍☠️ Brineshore — The Tide-Crowned Isle

### Overview

Brineshore is a rugged, storm-kissed pirate haven situated on a forested island west of the Orin mainland. Protected by sheer sea cliffs, hidden coves, and treacherous reefs, it has earned a reputation as a place where the law is shaped by tides, blades, and bargains.

It is equal parts:
- pirate refuge
- trading outpost
- smuggler’s crossroads
- ancestral territory tied to the Elemental Plane of Water

And below its waves is rumored to be Thal’Zirith, the ancient merfolk metropolis that only the elders speak about. Most don't fully believe it to be true, only that the area is known for its dangerous waters

### 🌊 History & Identity of Brineshore

###### Founded by Castaways & Outlaws

Brineshore began as a settlement for shipwreck survivors and deserters from both the New Lariel navy and mainland militias. Its people built homes among the dense seaside forests and cliffs, carving out a life away from continental control.

###### The Pact of the Tidecrown

Generations ago, a merefolk emissary from Thal’Zirith forged an agreement with Brineshore, allowing safe fishing in merfolk-claimed waters in exchange for protection from slavers and deep-sea predators.

This alliance is old, somewhat neglected, but still magically binding.

###### Cultural Flavor

Brineshore is a place of:
- ship bells and conch horns
- tide-based festivals
- driftwood architecture
- loud taverns, sea shanties, and open markets
- people who distrust crowns but welcome coin
- loose but fiercely respected local customs

Everyone here knows the sea is alive — with spirits, ancient currents, and deep magic.
