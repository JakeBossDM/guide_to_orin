This is the coast line that runs alongside the northern edge of Orin, connecting the [[2 - The World As We Know It/3. The Great Sea\|3. The Great Sea]]. The water is dark, and the beaches like charcoal. This is not the place most folks would vacations to. 
This Coast is directly adjacent to what is known as the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Witherlands\|Witherlands]]. Decimate plains that seem to be forgotten by nature and time.
