The Moonstrand River being 100 feet wide, winds its way from the north from the  [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Cerulean Coast\|Cerulean Coast]] making its way through the towering peaks of the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]], slicing through the city of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Lorendel\|Lorendel]] and eventually flowing into the marshy wetlands near [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Bayou\|The Bayou]]. 

The river itself is wide and slow-moving, its surface often shimmering with a silvery glow under the moonlight, which gives the river its name. The waters here are rich with nutrients, fed by the rains and runoff from the mountains, making it a vital resource for the Bayou settlement. The river’s journey through the marshlands is filled with life—vibrant green vegetation, winding channels, and misty air. In its course, the river gives life to the Bayou’s inhabitants, both plant and animal, who have learned to thrive in its unique, fertile ecosystem. [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Bayou\|The Bayou]] relies on the Moonstrand for everything, from food and water to trade and transport.

  

The area around the river becomes more treacherous and swampy as it passes through the marshlands before reaching [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Bayou\|The Bayou]], making navigation difficult for those not familiar with the winding channels and hidden hazards. Despite this, the river is the lifeblood of the region, and its currents guide the way for those who call it home.
