Nestled along the winding Moonstrand River, The Bayou is a settlement like no other—a harmonious blend of nature and craftsmanship, thriving in the marshy embrace of the river’s southern reaches. The settlement is built high among the sprawling boughs of ancient, moss-draped trees that tower above the swampy waters. Wooden treehouses, connected by rope bridges and woven walkways, form the heart of The Bayou, their designs seamlessly integrating with the trees they call home. The entire village seems alive with the sounds of the river and the rustling of the trees, creating an atmosphere both serene and wild.

  

The wood elves of The Bayou revere Selûne, goddess of the moon and the night, and her influence is felt in every corner of their community. Moonstone carvings and crescent-shaped motifs adorn their homes and sacred spaces, while their rituals and festivals are guided by the phases of the moon. The largest and most sacred tree in The Bayou houses the Temple of Selûne, a radiant structure draped in silver and adorned with crescent charms, where the people gather to offer prayers and seek her guidance.

  

The Bayou’s history is one of resilience and rediscovery. Its inhabitants are wood elves who were once cast out of Lorendel by the High Elves, seen as “lesser” for their deep connection to the wilderness and rejection of highborn traditions. Seeking solace, they found the Moonstrand River, which became their lifeline. They built their homes high in the trees to avoid the marsh’s dangers, and over generations, The Bayou became a vibrant and self-sufficient community—a haven for those who embrace the wilds.

  

Though the settlement is serene, life in The Bayou requires toughness and adaptability. The wood elves live off the land, fishing the river’s bounties, gathering herbs and plants from the marsh, and hunting the creatures that lurk in the shadows of the swamp. Despite the challenges, The Bayou is a place of beauty, tradition, and faith, where its people hold their heads high, fiercely proud of their heritage and the life they’ve built beneath the light of Selûne’s moon.
