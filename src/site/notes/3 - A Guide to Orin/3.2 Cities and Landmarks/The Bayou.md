## Overview

Nestled along the winding Moonstrand River, The Bayou is a settlement like no other—a harmonious blend of nature and craftsmanship, thriving in the marshy embrace of the river’s southern reaches. The settlement is built high among the sprawling boughs of ancient, moss-draped trees that tower above the swampy waters. Wooden treehouses, connected by rope bridges and woven walkways, form the heart of The Bayou, their designs seamlessly integrating with the trees they call home. The entire village seems alive with the sounds of the river and the rustling of the trees, creating an atmosphere both serene and wild.

  

The wood elves of The Bayou revere Selûne, goddess of the moon and the night, and her influence is felt in every corner of their community. Moonstone carvings and crescent-shaped motifs adorn their homes and sacred spaces, while their rituals and festivals are guided by the phases of the moon. The largest and most sacred tree in The Bayou houses the Temple of Selûne, a radiant structure draped in silver and adorned with crescent charms, where the people gather to offer prayers and seek her guidance.

  

The Bayou’s history is one of resilience and rediscovery. Its inhabitants are wood elves who were once cast out of Lorendel by the High Elves, seen as “lesser” for their deep connection to the wilderness and rejection of highborn traditions. Seeking solace, they found the Moonstrand River, which became their lifeline. They built their homes high in the trees to avoid the marsh’s dangers, and over generations, The Bayou became a vibrant and self-sufficient community—a haven for those who embrace the wilds.

  

Though the settlement is serene, life in The Bayou requires toughness and adaptability. The wood elves live off the land, fishing the river’s bounties, gathering herbs and plants from the marsh, and hunting the creatures that lurk in the shadows of the swamp. Despite the challenges, The Bayou is a place of beauty, tradition, and faith, where its people hold their heads high, fiercely proud of their heritage and the life they’ve built beneath the light of Selûne’s moon.

  

##### Old Name Given:
Leth’Telmora (“The Moon-Drowned Grove”)

— colloquially still called The Bayou by most.

  
##### Central Feature:

A massive, ancient world-tree (the Ancestral Tree of Loraemyr).

This is the heart, soul, and literal home of the Bayou elves.

Everything else in the region revolves around this one colossal structure.


### 🌳 STRUCTURE OF THE CITY 

##### A VERTICAL CASTE SYSTEM

Think of the tree like a living skyscraper made of branches, roots, spiraling ramps, vine-ladders, and woven bridges.

##### GROUND LEVEL — “The Roots District”

Lowest class.

Built around the tree’s enormous, buttressed roots and near the river.

Features:
- Mud huts, root-burrow homes, and crude wooden shacks
- Fisherfolk, hunters, tanners
- Laborers who maintain the canals and wetlands
- Dock areas for river skiffs and supply barges
- Thick fog and constant humidity
- Often ignored by the upper classes

The lowest class is closest to both:
- danger (spirits, beasts, flooding)
- outside contact (trade with Brewhaven & Lorendel)

They are the Bayou’s first line of defense and first point of conflict.

##### **MIDLEVEL — “The Boughs Districts”**

Middle class.

A sprawling residential and artisan band built around enormous branches.

Features:
- Homes woven from living wood (shaped by druidic magic)
- Rope bridges, canopy walkways, and lantern-lit platforms
- Artisans, herbalists, boat-crafters, mid-level druids
- Schools, shrines to Selûne, communal gardens
- Quiet, mist-lit pathways with glowing moss

This is where most adventurers or visitors get their first sense of Bayou elegance.


##### UPPER CANOPY — “The Silver Crown”

High class.

Near the highest branches, bathed in moonlight above the mist layer.

Features:
- White and silver structures shaped from the tree itself
- Homes of clan elders, wealthy merchants, respected druids
- Training terraces for moon-blossom archers
- Crystal pools that collect pure moonwater
- Soft, permanent bioluminescent glow

The air is thinner, dry, and cool up here — a reward for those who earned their place.


##### THE SUMMIT — “The Crown Hall”

The very top of the Ancestral Tree.

This is the highest social and spiritual point in the entire Bayou.

Features:
- The Council Hall of the Circle of the Lunar Current
- A beautifully woven living structure that looks like moonlight made solid
- Ceremony grounds
- The Moonstone Spire — a shard of celestial stone embedded in living wood
- Overlooks the entire region

This is where:
- leadership decisions are made
- Old Feywild rituals were performed
- The Bobbo (or governor) lives at this portion of the tree


### 🌙 LORE REASON FOR THE VERTICAL HIERARCHY


The Bayou elves believe:
“The higher one lives, the closer they are to Selûne.”

and

“Those who walk at the roots walk closest to the world’s wounds.”

This is not just social—it’s religious.

- Higher = more favor, purity, wisdom
- Lower = humility, labor, connection to the land

This creates a natural caste hierarchy that isn’t openly oppressive but is deeply ingrained.

### 🌫️ SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ANCESTRAL TREE

The tree is believed to be:
- planted by the first circle of the stars Druid 
- watered by the tears of Selûne
- Believed to be rooted to the Feywild 

Once rumored to be a living bridge between worlds. Ancient texts speak of this being the gateway used by warriors from the Feywild that came to assist during the Abyssal War. 

The Moonspire Fey Gate is inside its upper trunk (instead of a separate tree), which ties perfectly into your Feywild ring arc.

  
### 🧭 FACTION & POLITICAL IMPACT OF THE TREE-CITY

Upper Canopy
- Influential, protective of tradition
- Resist contact with Lorendel (they see high elves as arrogant meddlers)


Midlevel
- Pragmatic, balanced, open to trade
- Most artisans and scholars live here


Roots District
- Poor, struggling, often exploited
- Have the highest contact with outsiders
