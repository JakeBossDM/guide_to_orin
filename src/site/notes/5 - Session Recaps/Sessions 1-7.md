#### Session 1

Starting on the edge of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Dark Forest\|The Dark Forest]], and the  [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Moonstrand River\|Moonstrand River]], near the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Shrine of Gond\|Shrine of Gond]]. Billy Bob and Oog are seen caged at an Ogre camp. 

Gronk has been recruited by General Talos and they arrive at the camp to kill the ogre tribe. 

Long John was hired by an unknown person to gather whatever had called from the “Boom” in the sky. (A crack that opened up in the sky and shot out something)

Once Oog and Billy bob are released by Long John, they find V-9 locked in a crystal inside the shrine. In what seemed to fallen from the sky.

The party investigates the shrine and V-9 introduces everyone to what was his home.

A book is found in a hole under the shrine throat displayed multiple elemental images. The back page has a large eye that began to glow red, and the book catches flame and turns to ash. 

A large golden door can be found at the end of the shrine. Around it are symbols representing a phoenix, a mermaid, a stone creature, an eagle, a serpent like creature. But the door would not budge

The group accompanied General Talos back to New Lariel. But stopped along the road to rest for the night.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Session 2


The party gathers around the fire and tells everyone a little about themselves and how they got there. Before hitting the hay for the night. 

Voices were heard coming from [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/The Dark Forest\|The Dark Forest]]. V-9 and Billy Bob go to investigate. 
They overhear a hooded figure cursing at a frightened Ogre. Telling him how he failed to bring him what he needed. He then used a lightning infused dagger to kill the Ogre. 

V-9 and Billy Bob followed the attacker into a marshy open area, where the figure vanished out of thin air. 

The rest of the party joins the two. As they find an old grave in the marsh. After digging up the grave of what seemed to be a young girl. They took a ring that the corpse was holding onto.

In doing so, triggered many Blights to come from the trees and led to a fight. 

The party arrives in [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. 

They make their way through the "Slums" outside the entry gate, but not before kidnapping a halfling beggar named Doug, and took him into the city with them.

The party noticed that the city was being ran by an arcane essence, otherwise known as the [[4 - Items of Interest/Celestial Vein\|Celestial Vein]]. They saw the veins run through the cobblestone streets and into the lamps and buildings. 

Once the party arrived the central marketplace they hear a news caller yelling "The king is dead! Listen all! The king is dead!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Session 3

After hearing the news of the King of New Lariel passing away. This brought [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/General Talos\|General Talos]] into confusion and shock. She ran off to find answers and left the party with instructions to stay at the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.3 Business’s/Horned Helm Inn\|Horned Helm Inn]]. 

The group then stooped around the marketplace. Where they met a stubborn dwarf named [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/Thrain Ironforge\|Thrain Ironforge]] that worked at the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.3 Business’s/Forgeheart Armory\|Forgeheart Armory]]. A blacksmith shop. 

[[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/Thrain Ironforge\|Thrain Ironforge]], talked to V-9 about his dream of crafting a beautiful weapon made of [[4 - Items of Interest/Moonstone\|Moonstone]]. A material that can only be found at the peak of mountains in the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Graven Range\|Graven Range]]. He proceeded to offer the weapon to V-9 if he gives him the Moonstone to craft it with. 

V-9 and Long John, go into the library only to find a hidden alchemy lab being ran in the back.
Running it was a elderly gnome named [[Mortimer Thistlewick\|Mortimer Thistlewick]]. He was working on a big brew and after some interrogation from Long John he confessed to be trying to solve a mystery potion. One that is supposed to bring back the dead even stronger than they were before. 

They also discovered that [[Mortimer Thistlewick\|Mortimer Thistlewick]] was working on this potion for someone else. They found that in the lab was a secret entrance into the underground sewage channel. 

The party goes down into the passageway and makes it to the [[Underground Coliseum\|Underground Coliseum]]. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Session 4


After arriving at the [[Underground Coliseum\|Underground Coliseum]], they joined in on the fun and put a little gold in to challenge whatever the gamemaster had to throw at them in the arena. The only rule to the fight being no animals or creatures allowed. 

A suspicious figure seemed to be acting sketchy near Doug and V-9's steel companion Echo. So Long John decided to sit out on the fun and keep watch of the two of them. 

The party fights a very theatrical fight agains some nasty giant spiders and their offspring. 
Towards the end of the fight Oog wild shapes into his raptor form and kills the last spider. 

Due to breaking the rules the gamemaster named [[Thorn\|Thorn]] refused to give the winnings to the party. 

Gronk and Oog got upset and attempted to sort out the argument with violence. In doing so revealed that [[Thorn\|Thorn]] was actually a city official of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]], and he called the guards from above to come and raid the [[Underground Coliseum\|Underground Coliseum]]. 

This sends the entire place into a panic. For majority of the people attending were criminals. This panic forced Long John, Echo, and Doug to be pushed back out into the sewage pipes that led to the coliseum. 

As for the rest of the party, they break into [[Thorn\|Thorn]]'s office and are able to make it out with a nude painting of Thorn, a tiger pelt rug, 3 ledgers, a bloodstained gobled, and a robe of many things. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Session 5



The party is now on the run from the city guards. V-9 decided to buy dark cloaks for the rest of the party to disguise themselves as they make their way to the [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.3 Business’s/Horned Helm Inn\|Horned Helm Inn]]. 

The party sneaks through the many ally ways of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. During this time an old man was found begging in an ally. As Oog then begins to kick the elderly man for begging. 

The party makes it to the inn, and finds that the barkeep [[Dan\|Dan]] is a friend of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/General Talos\|General Talos]].

The party orders some food and then discuss all the items that they had found while in [[Thorn\|Thorn]]'s office. 

Oog asks [[Dan\|Dan]] if he knows anything about the Firbolgs. And he explains how the Firbolgs are nothing more than from fairy tales and old story books. When Dan explains this, Oog has a vision of being in a cave that seems to be out in the middle of an icy tundra. Barely being able to see he makes out two large, piercing white eyes shine through the snow. 

The party then goes to bed for the night. 

The next morning at breakfast, [[Dan\|Dan]] remembers to give the party a sending stone that [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/General Talos\|General Talos]] had left for them. And not long after her voice can be heard through the stone screaming "Run! Get out of the city! Get everyone out of the city! IT'S DEMONS"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Session 6



The party decides that they need some more information on [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.1 History & Events/3. The Abyssal War\|3. The Abyssal War]] and about the secret organization from generations back called the [[Ebon Conclave\|Ebon Conclave]]. They were to do this before going to check on [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.4 People/General Talos\|General Talos]]. 

The blanket of black smoke and ash seemed to be covering the city of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]], and the source seemed to be coming from the funeral site up near the palace. 

On the way to the funeral site they stop at the [[College of New Lariel\|College of New Lariel]]. They gather some books that could give them answers from the library. 

Billy Bob learns that his daughter is not currently at the school, but rather is on a study abroad for her archeology major. Apparently the groups study has taken them to [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Lorendel\|Lorendel]].

After fighting the fiend that was attempting to steal the books from the party. They then set out to the source of the smoke.

As they arrive it is a blood bath all over this old, seemingly forgotten temple. There are also piles of ash spread throughout. General Talos was severely injured but thankfully they were able to get her stable. 

They observed that there was a demonic ritual that was transcribed on the stone around the pyre that was for the king. In the black flames was an amethyst colored glow around what looked like a door. The goblet that V-9 possessed began to tremble and on the goblet was a riddle. 
The party believed that what they needed was blood from each person in the group in order for the gate to close. They tried to get Long John's blood but he refused to let it happen. 

Because of the failure to solve the riddle and close the gate. All hell was poured into the street of [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/New Lariel\|New Lariel]]. The party runs for the front gate of New Lariel, barely escaping the demons grasp. The same can not be said for the rest of Orin.

Roughly only 60% of the city was evacuated. It is unknown whether or not their are still survivors within the walls. 

Mages sealed the entry gates with a ritual spell. Preventing the demons and smoke to consume the rest of the land. 

After the party gets to a safe place, three men from the [[Kings Saints\|Kings Saints]] approached the party. These men being Asmodea, Hargan, and Zaelith. They ask for the group to join them at an estate so they can get any information that the group has to offer. 

Before heading to the estate, they decide to take Doug back to his home to be with his family. When they arrive they come to the sad truth that Doug has been imagining his family all along. With evidence around the house the party confirmed that there was a family at some point in time, due to the portraits set up in the house. Before the group leaves Dougs home, a wounded General Talos tells Gronk in secret, "Find Vaylen, he is in Brewhaven. He will help". 


The group then makes their way to the estate to meet with the Kings Saints. 
The three ask the party if they could use their knowledge of the gate they had seen and hire them to help close this gate. Starting with finding a man named Vaylen in Brewhaven. Not only to try and  close the gate but also the find the whereabouts of an ancient weapon called the [[Primordial Chaos\|Primordial Chaos]]. 
The party agrees that for 400 gold and 400 platinum they will carry out the mission. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Session 7


The group makes their way to [[3 - A Guide to Orin/3.2 Cities and Landmarks/Brewhaven\|Brewhaven]]. On their way they pass through a small farming village named [[Towgold\|Towgold]]. They see that something is not right with the town and that further investigation is required. 

They talk to the village leader and she gives them some leads to follow. Apparently there had been some monster/creature that has been stalking and kidnapping people from the village. There were many different testimonies and evidence to show that this was not just some wandering beast or animal. But that this was an intelligent, magical being. 

The party hears rustle out in the fields in the early morning, and all but Long John get out of bed to go investigate. A pack of wolves were getting their early breakfast with one of the villages donkeys. 
The party fends off the rest of the livestock that the wolves were after.

V-9 had a bit of an ill feeling about the whole thing and went to check out the rest of the village. In doing so he found that there were signs of someone that had made their way up a nearby cliffside. He then proceeded to investigate further and climbed the rope up the cliff side. He then found tracks that led through the forest, based on the footprints whatever it was was a shapeshifter. The rest of the party notices V-9's disappearance and goes after him. 

Finally when they are out of the forest and meet a small open passage in the forest. They are met with a familiar face from the village. One that they had spoken to the day prior about the attacks. The man acted as if he was there to find the monster, but in reality he was there to devour his next victims. 

The man changed shape back into its original form, being an Oni. With pale blue skin, large wide eyes, sharp jagged teeth, long white hair, and a dark cloak that was around him. He used a magical glaive to try to fend off the party but to no avail. 

The party killed the Oni. Gronk had gained himself a new glaive. 

The group then investigated the Oni's hut. Which was covered in blood and had bodies strung on the wall that seemed to be sucked dry of any life that they previously had. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Session 8

After defeating the Oni on the outskirts of Towgold,
the party further investigates the area. A couple of the party members dissect the Oni taking a few different body parts.

The hut is covered in blood stained wood and puddles of blood throughout the room. With several men and a boy chained to the wall. A ritual circle made of small and large stones are in the center of the room. And a massive bookcase stands in the corner of the room. 

After further investigation the captives appeared to be put in some sort of paralysis on the brink of death, unable to be healed my general medicine. The captives were unchained from the wall and later taken into town. 

The party found that the bookshelf is hiding a secret compartment underneath. After speaking the word “open” in elvish (taken from a note found in the room), the bookcase magically unlocks and is able to be moved. Inside the find “trophies” kept by the Oni from his past victims. Which seemed to be more than just the ones from Towgold. They also discovered a letter inside a journal that read “***Find the tome “Noctis Sanguinis”, gather the ingredients, and perform the ritual. This will grant you what you seek. Blood will be paid by seasons end. Happy hunting. - Lord M***.” 
The party finds the tome on the bookcase which then revealed a chant that seemed to be connected with the ritual that took place. 

The party tries to understand the Oni’s true intentions while standing inside the ritual. As Oog was inside the inner circle, Billy Bob mistakenly read the chant aloud in elvish. This bringing about  what seems to be a curse onto Oog. Distorting his appearance in what gives a dark aura to others, as did the Oni. 

A voice speaks to Oog as the ritual was made revealing that someone can now see Oog. And that they will be watching curiously. 

The body’s were taken back, along with the items taken by the Oni, to Towgold where the towns people were shocked to see the bodies. The town doctor attempted to heal the men but with no luck. Marlene gave the party some food and supplies for their journey and Towgold was beyond thankful. The party was sent off being seen as hero’s in the eyes to this small farming village.

Later that day the party meets a broken down wagon that reads “Quib’s Wonderous Oddities”. A elderly gnome who is an extremely energetic salesmen come from the wagon, pulling it is a giant goat. 

The party finds out that the cart broke down due to running from a group of bandits that have been pursuing Quib, in search of a specific item. The bandits then catch up with Quib and meet rhe party. While looking for the item a fight breaks out. The party then defeats the group of bandits while one of them surrendered and offered to give information on their guild and hideout. 

V9 decided to purchase the item the bandits were after which was a “Deck of Illusions”. Also finding out that the one who wanted this was called the “Deceiver” the leader of the bandit guild.

As the party narrowed down some negotiations with Quib, Oog and the young bandit go to look for the escaped horses in hopes to use for their journey. In doing so, stepped foot into the lair of none other than a Chimera.
